shower = .15
bath = .10
dishwasher = .03
washingmachine = .12
outdoors = .48
other = .12

monthly bill amount = user posted gallons
daily amount = monthly bill amount / 30

example:

10,000 gals / 30 = 330 gals daily
shower amount * .15 (shower average) = 49.5 gals
49.5 gals / 2x daily = 24.75 gals per shower
(max 3x daily = 74.25 gals, min 0)
